# SUDOKU

Sudoku is a game in which the playing field is a 9x9 grid divided into smaller 3x3 squares. The entire game board consists of 81 cells. At the beginning of the game, some numbers (from 1 to 9) are already placed in certain cells, referred to as clues. The player's objective is to fill the empty cells with numbers from 1 to 9 in such a way that in each row, each column, and each 3x3 small square, each digit appears only once.
